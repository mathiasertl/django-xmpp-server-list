Dear {{ key.user.username }},

Somebody (hopefully you) requested to reset your password at
http{% if request.is_secure %}s{% endif %}://{{request.get_host}}.
If you didn't attempt to reset your password, you can disregard
this message.

To reset your password, please go here:

    http{% if request.is_secure %}s{% endif %}://{{request.get_host}}{% url "reset_user_password" key=key.key %}
    
... which will log you in and redirect you to a form to allowing you to
change your password.

Cheers,
