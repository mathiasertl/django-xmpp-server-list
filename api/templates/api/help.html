<h1>Help for the API</h1>

This document describes how to use <a href="{% url "api" %}">the API</a>.

<h2>Output formats</h2>
Currently only JSON is supported, but other formats (XML, possibly others) will
be supported once I have the time.

<h2>Filter by country</h2>
You can filter servers by countries, by giving the 'country' request parameter:
<p class="api-example">
    {% url "api" %}?country=at
</p>

There is no really reliable way of determining the server a country is in. The
country is determined by the coordinates the server-admin gives when registering
the server (and they in turn are not in any way verified).

<h2>Require features</h2>
You can limit the output to servers that have a certain feature. To do that,
simply give the 'features' request parameter:

<p class="api-example">
    {% url "api" %}?features=tls,ipv6
</p>

The following features are currently recognized:
<table>
    <tr><th>feature</th><th>explanation</th></tr>
    <tr><td>plain</td><td>Servers that allow plain, unencrypted connections.</td></td>
    <tr><td>ssl</td><td>Servers that allow connections via SSL.</td></td>
    <tr><td>tls</td><td>Servers that allow connections via TLS.</td></td>
    <tr><td>ipv6</td><td>Servers that have IPv6 connectivity.</td></td>
</table>
<b>Note:</b> Currently only IPv6 is actually verified, all other features
will always return an empty list.

<h2>Output additional fields</h2>
By default, The API outputs only a list of JIDs. You can request more fields
via the 'fields' request parameter:

<p class="api-example">
    {% url "api" %}?fields=website,ca
</p>

Currently the following fields are supported:
<table>
    <tr><th>field</th><th>explanation</th></tr>
    <tr><td>launched</td><td>When the server was launched.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>location</td><td>Where the server is located.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>website</td><td>The website of the server.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>ca</td><td>The Certificate Autority of the server.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>software</td><td>The software this server uses.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>software_version</td><td>The version of the software the server uses.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>contact</td><td>The contact address of this server.</td></tr>
</table>

<b>Note:</b> The output of this feature is still subject to change.
