<p>
    Both your email-address and your JID have to be verified if you want to publish servers
    on this site. To this end, you will receive automated messages containing a validation URL
    on the respective account. You just have to open the validation URL to confirm your address.
</p>

<ul>
{% if not user.email_confirmed %}
    <li>An email containing a verification URL has been sent to {{ user.email }}.</li>
{% endif %}
{% if not user.jid_confirmed %}
    <li>
        <p>
            An XMPP message containing a verification URL has been sent to {{ user.jid }}.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Note:</strong> The verification message will come from {{ jid }}. Some clients
            block messages from accounts not in your buddy-list, so you might have to explicitely
            allow messages from that account.
        </p>
    </li>
{% endif %}
</ul>

<p>
    If you haven't received a confirmation message, you can just reload this page.
